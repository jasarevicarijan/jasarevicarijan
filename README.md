### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arijan!

I'm looking to become backend developer(TypeScript, NodeJs, MongoDB, MySQL).

Very motivated for learning new technologies and tools. Team player and ready to work, learm and improve myself even after work hours. 
Aiming to also learn frontend frameworks like React Js, and more backend languages like PHP, so one day I can become a fullstack developer.

Familiar with tools such as Jira, Git, BitBucket, Slack, Confluence.

Looking for new Junior/Entry level job in the backend, that would allow me to switch my carrer in that direction. I would prefer remote/hybrid way of working, 3 days office, 2 days remote for start 
if possible.

I'm currently working at Egeo d.o.o. as a support developer. Providing support on smaller projects for senior C# developer. Also have experience with migrating our internall web app from ASP.NET Web Forms to
newer stack that uses Node Js for backend and React Js for frontend. Also did some basic website development for clients, using HTML5, CSS, JS and WordPress.
