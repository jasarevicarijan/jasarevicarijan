### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arijan!

I'm looking to become backend developer(TypeScript, NodeJs, MongoDB, MySQL).

Very motivated for learning new technologies and tools. Team player and ready to work, learn and improve myself even after work hours. 
Aiming to also learn frontend frameworks like React Js, and more backend languages like PHP, so one day I can become a fullstack developer.

Familiar with, and used tools such as Jira, Git, GitHub, BitBucket, Slack, Confluence.

Looking for new Junior/Entry level job in the backend, that would allow me to switch my carrer in that direction.
